        <h2>Work History</h2>
        <h3>DeepMind - Staff Research Scientist</h3>
        <p>April 2016 to Current | London, UK</p>
        <p>As a Staff Research Scientist at DeepMind, I spearheaded a team of talented research scientists and engineers in developing multiple ground-breaking AI technologies. This journey resulted in key advancements in areas like fine-tuning generative AIs with AI-feedback, self-supervised learning, world models, exploration, and diffusion models. Notable projects include BLaDE, BYOL-Explore, and World Discovery Models, among others.</p>
        <p>My contributions extended from the project ideation phase through to execution, leading to high-impact publications and patents. Some significant projects in this regard include Noisy Networks for Exploration, Neural Belief Representations, and Minimax RL.</p>
        <p>Throughout my tenure, I had the privilege of collaborating with leading researchers on influential projects such as computer control with generative AI and Bootstrap-Graph representation Learning. This collaborative effort led to multiple well-cited publications, contributing to the broader AI and machine learning community.</p>
        
        <h3>Carnegie Mellon University and Northwestern University - Postdoctoral Fellow</h3>
        <p>October 2012 to April 2016</p>
        <p>As a Postdoctoral Fellow, I contributed to the publication of several peer-reviewed scientific papers for prestigious conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML. Notable works include 'A cryptography-based approach for movement decoding' and 'Convex Relaxation Regression'.</p>
